# Weekly 1:1 Updates Plugin

Automate your team's weekly 1:1 updates. Pull JIRA, Confluence, and manager feedback automatically to generate employee 1:1 prep or consolidate all team reports for manager review.

## What It Does

**For employees**: Automatically gathers your JIRA updates, manager feedback email, and notes from past 1:1s, then generates a summary you can review and edit before your meeting.

**For managers**: Pulls all direct reports' updates (each person's JIRA work, notes, and feedback) and generates individual 1:1 prep pages so you're ready for back-to-back meetings.

**Automatic infrastructure**: Creates your Confluence folder structure (Weekly Feedback space, employee subfolders, year folders, placeholder pages) and pre-scaffolds next quarter's pages monthly.

## How to Install

1. Download the `weekly-1-1-updates.plugin` file
2. In Claude Cowork, go to **Plugins** → **Install Plugin** → select this file
3. The plugin will appear in your installed plugins list

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Setup Wizard (Manager Only)

The manager should run the **Setup Wizard** skill first or drag and drop the weekly-1-1-updates.plugin into Claude Cowork:

1. Click the plugin → select "Setup Wizard" skill
2. Answer questions about your team:
   - Team name, manager email, timezone
   - Each team member's name, email, JIRA boards
   - How manager feedback emails are organized
   - Which Confluence space to use
   - Each person's 1:1 meeting time (auto-discover from Outlook or manual entry)
3. The wizard will validate your connectors and create Confluence infrastructure
4. Your team config is saved and reused by all other skills

**Required connectors before setup:**
- JIRA (to pull work updates)
- Confluence (to create 1:1 pages)
- Outlook/Email (to read feedback emails)
- Slack (optional, if your team uses it)
- Teams (optional, if your team uses it)

### Step 2: Employee Prep Their 1:1 (Weekly)

**For each employee**, trigger the **Employee Update** skill to prep for their 1:1:

- **Manual**: Ask "Prep my 1:1" or "Generate my 1:1 update"
- **Automatic** (if scheduled during setup): Runs on their 1:1 day/time each week, creates their Confluence page automatically

The skill:
- Pulls their JIRA updates (assigned issues, closed work, blockers)
- Reads manager feedback email
- Gathers notes from previous 1:1 pages
- Generates a summary page in Confluence
- They can review, edit, and add notes before the meeting

### Step 3: Manager Reviews All Reports (Weekly)

**For the manager**, trigger the **Manager Updates** skill to see all team members' prep:

- **Manual**: Ask "Pull all my reports' updates" or "Get team 1:1 updates"
- **Automatic** (if scheduled during setup): Runs on each employee's 1:1 day (morning), creates their page before the meeting

The skill:
- Pulls each person's JIRA, notes, and feedback
- Creates individual 1:1 pages for each team member
- Provides a summary view so you're prepared for all 1:1s

### Step 4: Auto-Scaffold Next Quarter (Monthly)

The **Scaffolder** runs automatically every month:

- Creates year folders (2026, 2027, etc.)
- Pre-creates blank 1:1 pages for next quarter (or half-year)
- Uses format: `[Name] - Manager 1:1 - [Date]`
- Pages are ready weeks in advance

You can also manually trigger: "Create next quarter pages"

## Configuration

All configuration happens in the **Setup Wizard**. Key settings:

- **Team members** — Who reports to you
- **JIRA boards** — Which boards each person works on (can be different per person)
- **Email feedback** — How feedback is organized (folder or direct emails)
- **Confluence space** — Where 1:1 pages live
- **Meeting times** — Day/time of each 1:1 (auto-discover from Outlook or manual)
- **Timezone** — For scheduling (e.g., America/Los_Angeles)
- **Scaffold frequency** — Quarterly or half-yearly (how far ahead to create pages)

To update config later, re-run the Setup Wizard.

## Skills Reference

| **Employee Update** | "Prep my 1:1" | Employees | Weekly (manual or scheduled) |

## Example Workflow

**Monday, January 15, 2026**

- **Manager Marc** runs Setup Wizard:
  - Team: Engineering
  - Reports: David (JIRA: BCR, BonusFinder Dev), Sarah (JIRA: BonusFinder Dev), Jordan (JIRA: Infrastructure)
  - David's 1:1: Monday 9am
  - Sarah's 1:1: Wednesday 9am
  - Jordan's 1:1: Friday 2pm
  - Confluence space: "Weekly Feedback"

**Monday 9am, January 15:**
- Plugin auto-triggers David's Employee Update → generates his Monday 1:1 page
- Plugin auto-triggers Manager Updates for David → sends Marc a summary
- Marc reviews David's page in Confluence (JIRA work, feedback, talking points)
- David reviews his own page, edits as needed, meets with Marc

**Wednesday 9am, January 17:**
- Plugin auto-triggers Sarah's Employee Update → generates her Wednesday 1:1 page
- Plugin auto-triggers Manager Updates for Sarah → sends Marc a summary
- Marc meets with Sarah

**Friday 2pm, January 19:**
- Plugin auto-triggers Jordan's Employee Update → generates his Friday 1:1 page
- Plugin auto-triggers Manager Updates for Jordan → sends Marc a summary
- Marc meets with Jordan

**Monthly (e.g., Feb 1 at 12am):**
- Scaffolder runs → creates Q1 pages (Jan–Mar) for David, Sarah, Jordan
- Pages are ready for the next quarter

## Troubleshooting

### "Connector not found"
Make sure you have JIRA, Confluence, and Outlook/Email connected in your workspace before running Setup Wizard.

### "Confluence page not created"
- Verify the Confluence space exists and you have write access
- Check that employee subfolders are created (Setup Wizard should do this)
- Re-run Setup Wizard to validate/fix the space

### "No JIRA updates showing"
- Make sure each person is assigned to issues in their configured JIRA boards
- Check that the issue date range matches "this week"
- Verify JIRA connector is connected and has access to those boards

### "Email feedback not found"
- Confirm the email folder/subject pattern matches your actual emails
- Check that the Outlook/Email connector is connected
- Re-run Setup Wizard to adjust the feedback email pattern

### "Scheduled tasks not running"
- Confirm setup was completed and config was saved
- Check your workspace settings for task scheduling
- Manually trigger the skill to test (e.g., "Prep my 1:1")

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Managers
- Review 1:1 pages 5–10 minutes before each meeting to prepare talking points
- Look for patterns across your team (shared blockers, capacity issues)
- Add your own notes/feedback to pages during or after meetings
- Use the monthly scaffolder to stay ahead—pages are ready in advance

### For Employees
- The generated summary is a starting point—personalize it with your context
- Check your manager's feedback email before the meeting
- Review previous 1:1 pages for continuity
- Ask clarifying questions in the Confluence page if something is unclear
- Add your own talking points and discussion topics

### Team Best Practices
- Set a consistent 1:1 schedule (same time each week) so automation runs reliably
- Use consistent JIRA board naming across your team
- Store feedback emails in a shared folder or with consistent subject lines
- Review 1:1 pages regularly to identify trends or issues needing escalation

## Privacy & Permissions

- **Employee pages**: Visible to manager + that employee only (set during setup)
- **Config**: Stored securely and used only by this plugin's skills
- **JIRA/Confluence/Email access**: Requires the connectors you authorize during setup
- **No data leaves your workspace**: All processing happens locally in Claude

## Support & Feedback

If you encounter issues or have feature requests:
- Check the **Troubleshooting** section above
- Re-run the **Setup Wizard** to validate your configuration
